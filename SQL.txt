Create a MySQL database and a table to store user information:

CREATE DATABASE mydb;
USE mydb;

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

Remember to update to the latest MySQL

Client does not support authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL client fix:


Execute the following query in MYSQL Workbench

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';

Where root as your user localhost as your URL and password as your password
Then run this query to refresh privileges:

flush privileges;

Try connecting using node after you do so.
If that doesn't work, try it without @'localhost' part.
